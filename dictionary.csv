Function	a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.	https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm
Parameter	a name used to specify what arguments a function will need when it is called. When a function is called, each parameter is assigned one of the argument values.	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14924825/what-are-arguments-in-python
Variable	a reserved memory location to store value.	https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_variable_types.htm
Argument	a value provided to a function when you call it.	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14924825/what-are-arguments-in-python
Dictionary	a way to store data just like a list, but instead of using only numbers to get the data, you can use almost anything. This lets you treat a dict like it's a database for storing and organizing data.	https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex39.html
Tuple	an immutable list. A tuple can not be changed in any way once it is created.	http://www.diveintopython.net/native_data_types/tuples.html
ASCII table	a table of characters for computers. It is binary code used by electronic equipment to handle text using the English alphabet, numbers, and other common symbols. ASCII is an abbreviation for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.	https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII
Module	a Python object with arbitrarily named attributes that you can bind and reference.	Simply, a module is a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes and variables. A module can also include runnable code.	https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_modules.htm
List	a most versatile datatype available in Python which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets.	https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_lists.htm
Set	a data type, which contains an unordered collection of unique and immutable objects.	http://www.python-course.eu/sets_frozensets.php
Class	a way to take a grouping of functions and data and place them inside a container so you can access them with the . (dot) operator.	https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex40.html
Lambda	a tool for building anonymous functions (i.e. functions that are not bound to a name), or more precisely, for building function objects.	http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/lambda_functions.hawk
For loop	a construct traditionally used when you have a piece of code which you want to repeat a fixed number of times. The Python for statement iterates over the members of a sequence in order.	https://wiki.python.org/moin/ForLoop
While loop	a construct used when a condition needs to be checked each iteration, or to repeat a piece of code forever.	https://wiki.python.org/moin/ForLoop
Iteration	a general term for taking each item of something, one after another. Any time you use a loop, explicit or implicit, to go over a group of items, that is iteration.	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9884132/what-exactly-are-pythons-iterator-iterable-and-iteration-protocols
